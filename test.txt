but yeah i feel like i should probably just let this take me
yeah exactly
crazily enough ive only been programming and interested in computer science since 3 years 😭
i mean i kinda was before
but too scared to think i could do good in it
truth is i had have a horrible experience with unity development back when i was like 14
im someone who likes to understand everything and the programming part was the most interesting me but the teacher at my private group class wouldnt really help me
i think they might have even assumed we knew how to code already
i mean i dont know how game devs approach scripting
ive almost always wanted to be certain of what i was writing to feel perfectly confident
i dont understand whats the point of using ai
my keyboard just went weird ish

i mean first it unavoidably causes doom in way too many ways
invitation to laziness
invitation to less thinking logically
invitation to get used to not do anything by yourself
invitation to want to solve problems fast whatever the cost
etc

"a calculator does that too"

yeah duhhh it does
and i literally have a hard time with maths because I let my brain just rely on a calculator

even worse!! I literally have a lot of maths problems because of how lazy and fast I want to go with maths
i dont think a mathematician would rely on a calculator 100% of the time
so why would someone who their job is to write algorithm would give up on that capacity to think logically to write algorithms and solve problems efficiently?
like this is absolutely counter productive and wrong
on a long term this is absolutely causing doom
also if that allows "programmers" that don't even know how to code
well, that don't even feel like coding
im sorry but if your job bores you, don't use AI to cope with that, just find another one you can love and be useful at
i dont know how to draw. I could just make ai art, but why would I? it's not my job at all

if i really wanted to make art, i'd take the time to learn to, but if I just feel lazy and unpassionated about art? then generating it would be absolutely worthless
i say that but i do consider myself an artist because of poetry
i even made a post about it
Well I wrote a comment that I shared on bluesky

art is really human actually so having it generated procedurally just is all against the concept of art
you dont make art for a purpose usually, you make it to express yourself
coding however well
i did see it as art before but i guess it's kind of a different thing but still really human
i've always seen it (for those who dont just copy paste of rewrite things they learned) as like putting a person's logical thinking in a visual way
which makes it amazing for me
logical thinking in itself is very abstract
people do think differently but it shows with programming
in a way i guess it is art but not really emotion and feeling more like logical sense
still obviously i feel there's something amazing at being able to structure things well
depending of how you make your code, fixing bugs or adding features can be either a nightmare or super easy
...that's one of the reason languages like Java appeared which encouraged the concept of Object Oriented Programming (OOP)
seperating logic and all, even tho i do feel like it went WAYYY too far
