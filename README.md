# pagecounter

## Build

To compile, use `cmake`.   
There is a `debug` and a `release`. (The latter is optioned with optimizations)  
Make sure to have `clang` installed and available.

You can also run the `distribute` shell script at the root of the project if your system allows it.

## Notes

The page counter also comes as a library, in fact, when compiling a library is also created individually from the
executable.

If not yet available in the RELEASES, if your OS support `sh`, you can run ```./distribute ```
